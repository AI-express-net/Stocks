This file contains general coding rules for any project. More rules will be added over time.

- Do not use pytest.skip() when an exception is being raised unless there's a comment just above it that says 'Skip: <reason>' Where <reason> must have a good reason to skip.
- When providing test data, add a comment when testing for particular data that has just been guessed.
