- Read all the files called requirements.md.
- There can be multiple requirement files, check all the modules in the project.
- All code must follow the general coding rules in coding_rules.md

When I ask you to 'verify plan' then check if the text above still matches the code. When changes need to be made to update the code to match the above text, show me the changes you're planning. All new code for this back tester needs to go in the 'back_tester' folder. Please write the plan verification results in a file that has the current time-stamp in the name so I can keep a list of changes over time. Also write the whole plan, with all its phases in a file called 'back-tester-plan-' with the current timestamp appended to the filename.
